## ‚úÖ How to Verify Saves are Working

### Watch the Browser Console (F12)

When you type in a question, you should see:
```
POST /api/baldrige/response 200 in XXXms
```

**Good signs:**
- ‚úÖ Status: 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Response time < 1 second
- ‚úÖ No errors

**Bad signs:**
- ‚ùå Status: 500 (means it didn't save)
- ‚ùå "Engine is not yet connected" error
- ‚ùå No network request at all

### Watch the Terminal/Server Logs

You should see:
```
[Baldrige Response API] Starting POST request
[Baldrige Response API] User ID: cmgpb93lf0001u0m0dv0gb5d0
POST /api/baldrige/response 200 in XXXms
```

## üîç Why This Happened

1. **Earlier:** When you first answered these questions, Prisma client had the SQLite cache issue
2. **Result:** Save requests returned 500 errors
3. **Frontend:** Kept track of "completed" questions in memory
4. **Database:** Never actually saved those responses
5. **Now:** PostgreSQL is fixed, but you need to re-answer those 26 questions

---

## üìä Track Your Progress

### Check Database Count

After answering each question, you can check:

```powershell
$query = 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM baldrige_responses WHERE "userId" = ''cmgpb93lf0001u0m0dv0gb5d0'';'
$env:PGPASSWORD="postgres"
& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin\psql.exe" -U postgres -d ocai_hub -c $query
```

**Watch the count increase:**
- Start: 71
- After Category 5: 77 (71 + 6)
- After Category 6: 85 (77 + 8)
- After Category 7: 97 (85 + 12) ‚úÖ Complete!

2. **Watch for 200 OK** - Confirms saves are working
3. **Use simple text** - "test answer" works fine for testing
