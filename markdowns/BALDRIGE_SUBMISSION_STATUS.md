## üîç How Submission Works

### Submission Endpoint: `/api/baldrige/submit`

```typescript
// When you click "Complete Assessment"
POST /api/baldrige/submit
{
  "surveyId": null // or specific survey ID
}

// Backend checks:
1. Total questions: 97
2. User's answered questions: count (must be 97)
3. All responses have non-empty text

// If 68/97 ‚Üí Rejection (400 Bad Request)
// If 97/97 ‚Üí Success (200 OK)
```

### Submission Creates:

1. **Baldrige Submission Record:**
   ```json

     "assessmentId": "BLD-ORG-2025-001",
     "userId": "cmgpb93lf0001u0m0dv0gb5d0",
     "organizationId": "cmgp0gvf40001u0bc17vj5lr8",

     "answeredQuestions": 97,
     "submittedAt": "2025-10-14T14:00:00.000Z"

   {
     "isCompleted": true,
     "completedAt": "2025-10-14T14:00:00.000Z"

## üìà Submission Validation Logic

### From `/api/baldrige/submit/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Get total questions
const totalQuestions = await prisma.baldrigeQuestion.count(); // 97

// Get user's answered questions
const answeredQuestions = await prisma.baldrigeResponse.count({
  where: {
    userId: userId,
    responseText: { not: '' }  // Must have text
  }
}); // Currently 68

// Validate
if (answeredQuestions < totalQuestions) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    message: `Incomplete assessment. You have answered ${answeredQuestions} out of ${totalQuestions} questions.`
  }, { status: 400 });
}

// If valid ‚Üí Create submission
```
