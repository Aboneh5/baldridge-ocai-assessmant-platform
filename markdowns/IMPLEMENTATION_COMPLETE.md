## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer ✅

**New Model: `AssessmentCredential`**

- Added `lastSavedAt` field (auto-save timestamp)

**Location**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

---

### 2. API Endpoints ✅

**Created 5 New API Routes:**

#### `POST /api/admin/assessment-credentials`
- Uploads CSV file with email/password pairs
- Validates each row (email format, password length)

- Returns validation errors if any

#### `GET /api/admin/assessment-credentials`
- Lists all credential batches
- Shows stats (total, used, unused, expired)
- Groups credentials by batch
- Includes organization info

#### `PATCH /api/admin/assessment-credentials/[batchId]`
- Extends expiration date for entire batch
- Can activate/deactivate batch
- Updates all credentials in batch at once

#### `DELETE /api/admin/assessment-credentials/[batchId]`
- Deletes entire batch
- Removes all credentials in batch
- Cannot be undone

#### `POST /api/auth/credential-login`
- Authenticates employees with email/password
- Checks validity and expiration
- Updates login stats (lastUsedAt, loginCount)
- Returns available assessments
- Redirects to appropriate page

#### `GET/POST /api/assessments/progress`

### 5. Progress Saving ✅

**OCAI Assessment:**
