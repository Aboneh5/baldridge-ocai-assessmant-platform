# Employee Results View - Fix Complete

## 🐛 Issue Identified

When employees clicked "View Results" button for completed OCAI assessments, they were redirected to the home page instead of seeing their results.

**Root Cause**: The `/ocai/results` page was restricted to SYSTEM_ADMIN and FACILITATOR roles only, checking for these roles and redirecting employees to home page.

```typescript
// Old code - blocked employees
if (parsedUser.role !== 'SYSTEM_ADMIN' && parsedUser.role !== 'FACILITATOR') {
  router.push('/');  // ❌ Redirects employees to home
  return;
}
```
