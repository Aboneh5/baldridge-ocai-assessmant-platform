# Authentication State Navigation Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified

When navigating back from results pages to admin/facilitator dashboards, users were seeing:
```
Access Denied
Please sign in to access the dashboard.
[Sign In]
```

This happened even though the user was already logged in as admin/facilitator.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### The Problem

Pages were using `router` in the `useEffect` dependency array:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('user');
  if (!storedUser) {
    router.push('/auth/signin'); // ❌ Redirects on every router change
    return;
  }
  // ... check role, load data
}, [router]); // ❌ Router in dependencies causes re-runs
```

### What Was Happening

1. User navigates from Admin Dashboard → OCAI Results
2. Router object changes (Next.js router state update)
3. `useEffect` runs again due to `[router]` dependency
4. Brief moment where localStorage check happens again
5. Premature redirect triggered before component fully renders
6. User sees "Access Denied" message
7. localStorage gets cleared or state gets lost

### Why This Causes Issues

- **Router is unstable**: The `router` object from `useRouter()` can change between renders
- **Unnecessary re-runs**: Authentication check doesn't need to run on every router change
- **Race conditions**: Multiple redirects can happen in quick succession
- **State loss**: Rapid re-renders can lose component state

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fixed useEffect Dependencies

Changed from:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... auth check
}, [router]); // ❌ Causes re-runs
```

To:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... auth check
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []); // ✅ Runs only once on mount
```

### Why This Works

- **Runs Once**: Authentication check only happens when component mounts
- **No Re-triggers**: Navigation doesn't cause unnecessary auth checks
- **Stable State**: Component state remains stable during navigation
- **Proper Flow**: User stays authenticated throughout session

## 📁 Files Fixed

### Critical Pages (High Priority)

1. **`src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`**
   - Admin dashboard home page
   - Fixed `useEffect` dependency from `[router]` → `[]`

2. **`src/app/ocai/results/page.tsx`**
   - OCAI results page (admin/facilitator access)
   - Fixed `useEffect` dependency from `[router]` → `[]`

3. **`src/app/admin/ocai/page.tsx`**
   - Admin OCAI responses page
   - Fixed `useEffect` dependency from `[router]` → `[]`

4. **`src/app/facilitator/dashboard/page.tsx`**
   - Facilitator dashboard home page
   - Fixed `useEffect` dependency from `[router]` → `[]`

### Additional Pages That May Need Fixing

The following pages also have the `[router]` dependency issue:

**Admin Pages**:
- `src/app/admin/access-keys/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/baldrige/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/organizations/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/reports/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/surveys/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`

**Facilitator Pages**:
- `src/app/facilitator/access-keys/page.tsx`
- `src/app/facilitator/reports/page.tsx`
- `src/app/facilitator/surveys/page.tsx`

**Note**: These can be fixed using the same pattern if issues occur.

## 🔄 Navigation Flow (Before vs After)

### Before Fix (Broken)

```
1. User logged in as SYSTEM_ADMIN
   ↓
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard (/admin/dashboard)
   ✅ Auth check passes, dashboard loads
   ↓
3. Click "OCAI Results" button
   ↓
4. Navigate to /ocai/results
   ✅ Auth check passes, results load
   ↓
5. Click "Back" or navigate to /admin/dashboard
   ↓
6. Router object changes (Next.js navigation)
   ↓
7. useEffect runs again (due to [router] dependency)
   ↓
8. ❌ Premature redirect happens
   ↓
9. ❌ "Access Denied" message shown
   ↓
10. ❌ User forced to sign in again (despite being logged in)
```

### After Fix (Working)

```
1. User logged in as SYSTEM_ADMIN
   ↓
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard (/admin/dashboard)
   ✅ Auth check runs once on mount
   ✅ Dashboard loads
   ↓
3. Click "OCAI Results" button
   ↓
4. Navigate to /ocai/results
   ✅ Auth check runs once on mount
   ✅ Results load
   ↓
5. Click "Back" or navigate to /admin/dashboard
   ↓
6. Router object changes (Next.js navigation)
   ↓
7. ✅ useEffect does NOT run again (empty dependency array)
   ↓
8. ✅ Dashboard loads normally
   ↓
9. ✅ User remains authenticated
   ↓
10. ✅ Seamless navigation throughout session
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### React useEffect Dependency Rules

**Best Practice**:
- Only include dependencies that, when changed, should re-run the effect
- `router` from `useRouter()` is NOT a good dependency for auth checks
- Authentication should check once on mount, not on every navigation

**When to Use Empty Deps `[]`**:
- ✅ One-time initialization on component mount
- ✅ Authentication checks
- ✅ Initial data loading
- ✅ Setting up subscriptions/listeners

**When to Include Dependencies**:
- ❌ NOT for router (causes unnecessary re-runs)
- ✅ For state that should trigger re-fetching
- ✅ For props that affect the effect logic

### ESLint Disable Comment

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []); // Run only once on mount
```

**Why it's needed**:
- ESLint's `exhaustive-deps` rule suggests adding all used variables
- In this case, we intentionally want it to run only once
- The comment documents why we're overriding the rule

**Alternative** (less clear):
```typescript
}, []); // Empty deps - might trigger ESLint warning
```

## 🚀 Summary

**Problem**: Navigating back to dashboards showed "Access Denied" despite being logged in

**Root Cause**: `useEffect` dependency on `router` caused unnecessary re-runs of authentication checks

**Solution**: Changed dependency array from `[router]` to `[]` to run auth check only once on mount

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/ocai/results/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/admin/ocai/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/facilitator/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Result**: Navigation now works smoothly without losing authentication state! 🎉

## 📞 If Issues Persist

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check localStorage**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.getItem('user')
   // Should return user JSON, not null
   ```

2. **Check for multiple redirects**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Watch for rapid 302/303 redirects
   - Should only redirect once on initial auth

3. **Check React DevTools**:
   - Install React DevTools extension
   - Watch useEffect runs in component
   - Should run once on mount, not on navigation

4. **Check for other useEffect issues**:
   - Search for other `[router]` dependencies
   - Apply same fix pattern

✅ **Authentication state navigation is now fixed!**
