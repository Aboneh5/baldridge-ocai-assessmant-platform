### ✅ Validation Working:
```json

  "success": false,
  "message": "Assessment incomplete. Please answer all questions before submitting. 71/97 questions completed.",
  "data": {
    "answeredQuestions": 71,
    "totalQuestions": 97,

  }
}
```

This is **EXACTLY** how it should work! The API is protecting data integrity by ensuring all questions are answered before submission.

## 💡 Pro Tip

The API is **helping you** by showing exactly which questions are unanswered. Use this information to navigate directly to the incomplete sections!

**Example:**
```json
{
  "itemCode": "5.2a(1)",
  "category": "Workforce",
  "subcategory": "Workforce Engagement"
}
```
This tells you: Go to Category 5 (Workforce) → Workforce Engagement → Question 5.2a(1)

### The Truth:
- ✅ **Submission API is working perfectly**
