# Baldrige Assessment API and Language Switching Fix

## Root Cause Identified âœ…

**PRIMARY ISSUE: Prisma Client Mismatch**
The Prisma client in `node_modules/.prisma` was out of sync with the PostgreSQL database configuration, causing all API endpoints to fail with 500 errors.

**SOLUTION:**
1. Stop development server
2. Regenerate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
3. Restart development server from correct directory: `cd tenadam-assessment && npm run dev`

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Language Switching During Assessment
**Problem:** Users were experiencing unexpected language switches from English to Amharic during the Baldrige assessment, making the assessment inaccessible.

**Root Cause:** The `AssessmentHubNav` component displayed a language switcher on all assessment pages, allowing users to accidentally change languages mid-assessment.

**Solution:** 
- Removed `LanguageSwitcher` component from `assessment-hub-nav.tsx`
- Added comment explaining why it was removed
- This matches the design decision already made in the assessment page itself (where LanguageSwitcher was previously removed)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/navigation/assessment-hub-nav.tsx`

### 2. API 500 Errors
**Problem:** Three API endpoints were returning 500 Internal Server Error:
- `/api/baldrige/check-completion`
- `/api/baldrige/progress`
- `/api/baldrige/categories`

**Root Cause:** 
- Incorrect import of `getServerSession` from 'next-auth' instead of 'next-auth/next'
- Lack of error handling and logging made it difficult to diagnose issues

**Solution:**
- Fixed import statement in `get-user-id.ts` to use 'next-auth/next'
- Added comprehensive error logging to all three API endpoints
- Added try-catch wrapper around session retrieval
- Improved error messages to include error name, message, and stack trace

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/get-user-id.ts` - Fixed import and added error handling
- `src/app/api/baldrige/categories/route.ts` - Added detailed logging (GET)
- `src/app/api/baldrige/progress/route.ts` - Added detailed logging (GET & POST)
- `src/app/api/baldrige/check-completion/route.ts` - Added detailed logging (GET)
- `src/app/api/baldrige/response/route.ts` - Added detailed logging (POST)
- `src/app/api/baldrige/submit/route.ts` - Added detailed logging (POST)

## Database Verification

Verified that Baldrige data is properly seeded in the database:
- 8 categories (including Organizational Profile)
- 19 subcategories
- 97 questions

Created helper script: `check-baldrige-db.js` for easy database verification.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clear Browser Data:**
   - Clear localStorage
   - Clear session data
   - Refresh the page

2. **Test Flow:**
   - Sign in with access key or credentials
   - Navigate to Baldrige assessment
   - Verify language stays in English (or chosen language)
   - Verify no language switcher appears in nav bar
   - Attempt to answer questions
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors

3. **Check Server Logs:**
   - Look for detailed logging from the API endpoints
   - Verify user ID is being retrieved correctly
   - Check for any database connection issues

## Additional Notes

- The LanguageSwitcher is still available on non-assessment pages
- Users should select their preferred language before starting an assessment
- All responses are auto-saved during assessment
- The language preference is stored in localStorage

## Current Status of Assessment Data

**Database:** PostgreSQL (ocai_hub)
**Saved Responses:** 49 out of 97 questions
**User:** test@gmail.com (ID: cmgpb93lf0001u0m0dv0gb5d0)

**Missing Responses (51 questions):**
- Strategy: 1 question
- Customers: 11 questions  
- Measurement/Analysis: 9 questions
- Workforce: 10 questions
- Operations: 8 questions
- Results: 12 questions

**To complete the assessment:**
1. Server should now be running with fixed Prisma client
2. Navigate to the categories listed above
3. Fill in the missing questions (they will show as empty in the UI)
4. Responses should now save successfully (no more 500 errors)
5. Submit when all 97 questions are completed

**Utility Script:** Run `node show-missing-questions.js` to see which specific question codes need answers.

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

If 500 errors continue:
1. Check server console for detailed error logs (now added)
2. Verify Prisma client was regenerated: `npx prisma generate`
3. Ensure server was restarted from tenadam-assessment directory
4. Check PostgreSQL connection: `node test-postgres-baldrige.js`

If language issues continue:
1. Check browser localStorage for 'locale' key
2. Verify locale is set before starting assessment
3. Language switcher should no longer appear in assessment nav bar
