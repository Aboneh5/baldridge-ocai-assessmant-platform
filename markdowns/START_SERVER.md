# 🚀 Starting the Server - Final Steps

## ✅ What's Already Done

Your PostgreSQL database is **fully configured and ready**:

- ✅ PostgreSQL 17 is running
- ✅ Database `ocai_hub` exists
- ✅ Schema is synced (all tables created)
- ✅ Baldrige data is seeded:
  - 8 Categories
  - 19 Subcategories  
  - 97 Questions

## ⚠️ Current Issue

The Prisma client needs to be regenerated, but it's locked by running Node.js processes.

## 🔧 Solution - Stop Existing Processes

You have two options:

### Option 1: Close All Node Processes (Recommended)

1. **Close any terminals running `npm run dev`**
   - Look for terminals with the dev server
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop them

2. **Or stop all Node processes:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
   ```

### Option 2: Restart Your Computer
This will clean up all locked files.

## 🚀 After Stopping Processes

Run these commands in order:

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\Lu\prog\baldrige work\tenadam-assessment"

# 2. Clean Prisma cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.prisma -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 3. Generate Prisma Client for PostgreSQL
npx prisma generate

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## ✨ Verification

Once the server starts, you should see:

```
✓ Ready in X.Xs
○ Compiling / ...
✓ Compiled / in X.Xs
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:3010**

### Test Baldrige Assessment:

1. Go to http://localhost:3010
2. Sign in or use an access key
3. Navigate to Baldrige Assessment
4. **You should see:**
   - All categories loading
   - Questions displaying correctly
   - No "Engine is not yet connected" errors
   - Language staying consistent

## 🎯 Quick Test Command

After server starts, test the API:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3010/api/baldrige/categories" -UseBasicParsing
```

Should return status 200 with JSON data.

**Next:** Once the server is running, test the Baldrige assessment to confirm everything works!
