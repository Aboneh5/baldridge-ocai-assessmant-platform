**Step 1: Access the Assessment**
1. Sign in using your credentials or access key
2. Click **"OCAI (Culture Assessment)"** card

Question: Dominant Characteristics

Now (Current):
A: 30 points  (Somewhat like us)
B: 10 points  (Not really like us)
C: 40 points  (Very much like us!)
D: 20 points  (A bit like us)
─────────────

3. **Management of Employees** - How people are managed
4. **Organization Glue** - What holds the organization together
5. **Strategic Emphases** - What's emphasized strategically
6. **Criteria of Success** - How success is defined

---

### Understanding Your OCAI Results

#### What You'll See

**1. Radar Chart**
- Spider/radar chart showing 4 culture types
- Blue line = Current culture
- Green line = Preferred culture

**2. Score Table**

| Culture Type | Current | Preferred | Change |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Clan        | 28      | 35        | +7 ↑   |
| Adhocracy   | 22      | 25        | +3 ↑   |
| Market      | 30      | 20        | -10 ↓  |
| Hierarchy   | 20      | 20        | 0 →    |

**3. Interpretation**

- **Positive (+)** = You want MORE of this culture type
- **Negative (-)** = You want LESS of this culture type
- **Zero (0)** = Current and preferred are aligned

#### What This Means

**Example:**
- **Clan +7** → Want more teamwork and collaboration
- **Market -10** → Want less competition and results-focus
- **Hierarchy 0** → Happy with current structure

This shows your organization wants to shift from a competitive (Market) culture toward a more collaborative (Clan) culture.

**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes

**Format:** Open-ended text responses

**Total Questions:** 97 questions across 8 categories

**What Makes This Different:**
- Longer than OCAI (more comprehensive)
- Written responses (not point allocation)
- Covers entire organizational system
- Auto-saves as you type

---

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Access the Assessment**
1. Sign in with your credentials
2. Click **"Baldrige Excellence"** card
3. Read the introduction and guidelines
4. Click **"Start Baldrige Assessment"**

**Step 2: Organizational Profile**

First, you'll answer foundational questions:
- What are your main products/services?
- What is your mission and vision?
- Who are your customers?
- What are your key challenges?

These help contextualize your responses.

**Step 3: Navigate Categories**

The assessment is organized into categories:
```
📁 Category 1: Leadership
   📄 Subcategory 1.1: Senior Leadership
      ❓ Question 1.1a(1)
      ❓ Question 1.1a(2)
      ...
   📄 Subcategory 1.2: Governance
      ❓ Question 1.2a(1)
      ...
```

**Step 4: Answer Questions**

For each question:

1. **Read the question carefully**
   - Understand what's being asked
   - Note any specific focus areas

2. **Think about your organization**
   - Consider current practices
   - Think of specific examples
   - Be honest and realistic

3. **Type your response**
   - Be specific and detailed
   - Provide examples where possible
   - Explain "how" not just "what"

4. **Auto-save triggers**
   - Saves automatically as you type
   - Also saves when you move to next question
   - Green "Saved" indicator appears

**Example Good Response:**
```
Question: How do senior leaders set and deploy your 
organization's vision and values?

Good Answer:
"Our CEO holds quarterly town halls where she personally 
presents our vision and values. Each department then 
translates these into specific goals. For example, our 
customer service team created a 'Customer First' initiative 
directly aligned with our value of putting customers at the 
center. Senior leaders also demonstrate values through 
weekly recognition of employees who exemplify them. We use 
our intranet to share stories and maintain a 'Living Our 
Values' dashboard that tracks related metrics."

Why it's good:
✓ Specific practices mentioned (town halls, department goals)
✓ Real examples (Customer First initiative)
✓ Shows deployment method (intranet, dashboard)
✓ Demonstrates leader involvement
```

**Example Poor Response:**
```
Poor Answer:
"We have vision and values. Leaders talk about them 
sometimes. Everyone knows them."

Why it's poor:
✗ Too vague
✗ No specific methods described
✗ No examples provided
✗ Doesn't explain "how"
```

**Step 5: Progress Tracking**

You'll see your progress:

### Managing Assessment Credentials

Assessment credentials provide individual email/password access for employees with **full tracking, progress auto-save, and accountability**. This is the most secure and trackable method for employee participation.

#### What are Assessment Credentials?

**Assessment Credentials** are individual email/password pairs that:
- ✅ Give each employee unique login credentials
- ✅ Auto-save progress to the server (resume from any device)
- ✅ Track who completed which assessment with timestamps
- ✅ Provide better accountability than shared access keys
- ✅ Expire after a set date for security
- ✅ Can be managed in batches for bulk operations

**Key Differences from Access Keys:**

| Feature | Assessment Credentials | Access Keys |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Email + Password (unique per employee) | Shared code (multiple employees) |
| **Progress Save** | Server-side (any device) | Browser only (same device) |
| **Tracking** | Individual user tracked | Group tracking only |
| **Accountability** | High (know who completed) | Low (shared key) |
| **Privacy** | Moderate (admin sees email) | High (optional name) |
| **Expiration** | Per batch | Per key |
| **Best For** | Individual tracking, accountability | Anonymous participation |

#### Security Best Practices

**For Administrators:**

1. **Use Temporary Passwords:**
   - Generate simple, temporary passwords (e.g., "TempPass2025")
   - Instruct employees to change after first login (if that feature is enabled)

2. **Set Reasonable Expiration Dates:**
   - 30-60 days for standard campaigns
   - 90 days for longer initiatives
   - Don't set years in the future

3. **Monitor Usage:**
   - Check "Used" vs "Unused" counts regularly
   - Send reminders to employees who haven't logged in
   - Extend expiration if needed before it expires

4. **Delete Expired Batches:**
   - Clean up old batches after assessment campaigns
   - Keep system organized

5. **Track Participation:**
   - Export credential usage reports
   - Identify low participation
   - Follow up with unused credentials

**For Employees:**

When receiving credentials:
- Keep email/password secure
- Don't share with others
- Complete assessment before expiration
- Contact admin if forgotten password

- OCAI takes 15-20 minutes, Baldrige takes 45-60 minutes
- Both provide valuable insights but measure different things

**Q: Can I take both assessments?**

1. Complete OCAI first (shorter)
2. Then complete Baldrige

---

### Assessment Questions

- **Baldrige:** Auto-saves to server, can resume from any device
- **Credential users:** Both save to server for resuming anywhere

**Q: Can I change my answers after submitting?**

**A:** No. Once submitted, responses are final. This ensures data integrity and prevents gaming results.

**Q: What if I don't know the answer to a Baldrige question?**

**A:**

- No wrong answers - honest assessment is the goal

**Q: For OCAI, what if I can't distribute exactly 100 points?**
