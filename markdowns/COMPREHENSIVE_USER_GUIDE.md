**Step 1: Access the Assessment**
1. Sign in using your credentials or access key
2. Click **"OCAI (Culture Assessment)"** card
3. Read the introduction page

For each question, you'll see **4 statements (A, B, C, D)**:

4. Give more points to statements that better describe your organization
5. The total MUST equal 100

**Example:**
```
Question: Dominant Characteristics

Now (Current):
A: 30 points  (Somewhat like us)
B: 10 points  (Not really like us)
C: 40 points  (Very much like us!)
D: 20 points  (A bit like us)
─────────────
Total: 100 ✓
```

2. **Organizational Leadership** - Leadership style
3. **Management of Employees** - How people are managed
4. **Organization Glue** - What holds the organization together
5. **Strategic Emphases** - What's emphasized strategically
6. **Criteria of Success** - How success is defined

---

### Understanding Your OCAI Results

#### What You'll See

**1. Radar Chart**
- Spider/radar chart showing 4 culture types
- Blue line = Current culture
- Green line = Preferred culture

**2. Score Table**

| Culture Type | Current | Preferred | Change |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Clan        | 28      | 35        | +7 ↑   |
| Adhocracy   | 22      | 25        | +3 ↑   |
| Market      | 30      | 20        | -10 ↓  |
| Hierarchy   | 20      | 20        | 0 →    |

**3. Interpretation**

- **Positive (+)** = You want MORE of this culture type
- **Negative (-)** = You want LESS of this culture type
- **Zero (0)** = Current and preferred are aligned

#### What This Means

**Example:**
- **Clan +7** → Want more teamwork and collaboration
- **Market -10** → Want less competition and results-focus
- **Hierarchy 0** → Happy with current structure

This shows your organization wants to shift from a competitive (Market) culture toward a more collaborative (Clan) culture.

- Auto-saves as you type

---

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Access the Assessment**
1. Sign in with your credentials
2. Click **"Baldrige Excellence"** card
3. Read the introduction and guidelines
4. Click **"Start Baldrige Assessment"**

**Step 2: Organizational Profile**

First, you'll answer foundational questions:
- What are your main products/services?
- What is your mission and vision?
- Who are your customers?
- What are your key challenges?

These help contextualize your responses.

**Step 3: Navigate Categories**

The assessment is organized into categories:
```
📁 Category 1: Leadership
   📄 Subcategory 1.1: Senior Leadership
      ❓ Question 1.1a(1)
      ❓ Question 1.1a(2)
      ...
   📄 Subcategory 1.2: Governance
      ❓ Question 1.2a(1)
      ...
```

**Step 4: Answer Questions**

For each question:

1. **Read the question carefully**
   - Understand what's being asked
   - Note any specific focus areas

2. **Think about your organization**
   - Consider current practices
   - Think of specific examples
   - Be honest and realistic

3. **Type your response**
   - Be specific and detailed
   - Provide examples where possible
   - Explain "how" not just "what"

4. **Auto-save triggers**
   - Saves automatically as you type
   - Also saves when you move to next question
   - Green "Saved" indicator appears

**Example Good Response:**
```
Question: How do senior leaders set and deploy your 
organization's vision and values?

Good Answer:
"Our CEO holds quarterly town halls where she personally 
presents our vision and values. Each department then 
translates these into specific goals. For example, our 
customer service team created a 'Customer First' initiative 
directly aligned with our value of putting customers at the 
center. Senior leaders also demonstrate values through 
weekly recognition of employees who exemplify them. We use 
our intranet to share stories and maintain a 'Living Our 
Values' dashboard that tracks related metrics."

Why it's good:
✓ Specific practices mentioned (town halls, department goals)
✓ Real examples (Customer First initiative)
✓ Shows deployment method (intranet, dashboard)
✓ Demonstrates leader involvement
```

**Example Poor Response:**
```
Poor Answer:
"We have vision and values. Leaders talk about them 
sometimes. Everyone knows them."

Why it's poor:
✗ Too vague
✗ No specific methods described
✗ No examples provided
✗ Doesn't explain "how"
```

**Step 5: Progress Tracking**

You'll see your progress:
- **Category level:** 5 of 8 categories complete

- OCAI takes 15-20 minutes, Baldrige takes 45-60 minutes
- Both provide valuable insights but measure different things

**Q: Can I take both assessments?**

1. Complete OCAI first (shorter)
2. Then complete Baldrige

- **Baldrige:** Auto-saves to server, can resume from any device
- **Credential users:** Both save to server for resuming anywhere

**Q: Can I change my answers after submitting?**

**A:** No. Once submitted, responses are final. This ensures data integrity and prevents gaming results.

**Q: What if I don't know the answer to a Baldrige question?**

**A:** 
- Be honest and indicate "This is not currently practiced" or "Unknown"
- Type "N/A" if question doesn't apply

- No wrong answers - honest assessment is the goal

**Q: For OCAI, what if I can't distribute exactly 100 points?**

**A:** 
- Total MUST equal 100 for each question
- Use all 100 points (not 95, not 105)
- It's OK to use 0 for options that don't fit at all
