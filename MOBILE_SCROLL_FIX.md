# 📱 Mobile Scroll Fix - Assessment Pages

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** On mobile devices (phones, tablets), when users navigate between questions in the OCAI and Baldrige assessments, the page would start at the bottom instead of scrolling to the top, making it difficult to see the questions.

**Solution:** Added automatic scroll-to-top functionality when:
1. The assessment component first loads
2. Users click "Next" to go to the next question
3. Users click "Previous" to go back
4. Users change categories/subcategories in Baldrige

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. OCAI Assessment
**File:** `src/components/ocai/ocai-questionnaire.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added scroll-to-top on component mount (when assessment starts)
- Added scroll-to-top in `handleNext()` function
- Added scroll-to-top in `handlePrevious()` function

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Scroll to top when component mounts (important for mobile)
useEffect(() => {
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
}, [])

// In handleNext() and handlePrevious()
window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
```

### 2. Baldrige Assessment
**File:** `src/app/baldrige/assessment/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced existing scroll functionality to also scroll the main window (not just the container)

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Also scroll window to top for better mobile experience
window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Scroll Behavior:
```typescript
window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
```

- **`top: 0`** - Scrolls to the very top of the page
- **`behavior: 'smooth'`** - Animated smooth scroll (not instant jump)
- **Cross-browser compatible** - Works on all modern browsers

### Why This Works:
1. **`window.scrollTo()`** - Scrolls the main browser window
2. **Smooth behavior** - Better UX than instant jump
3. **Called at right time** - Before content changes become visible
