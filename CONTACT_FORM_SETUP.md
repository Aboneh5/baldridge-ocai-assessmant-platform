# Contact Form Email Setup

The contact form is now fully functional and will send emails to `info@tenadamconsulting.com` when users submit the form.

## Setup Required

To make the email functionality work, you need to configure email credentials:

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in the `ocai-hub` directory with the following variables:

```env
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

### 2. Email Service Options

#### Option A: Gmail (Recommended for testing)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to Google Account settings > Security > App passwords
3. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
4. Use your Gmail address as `SMTP_USER`
5. Use the app password as `SMTP_PASS`

#### Option B: Other Email Services
You can modify the transporter configuration in `/src/app/api/contact/route.ts` to use:
- **SendGrid**: Replace with SendGrid API
- **Mailgun**: Use Mailgun SMTP settings
- **Outlook**: Use `outlook.office365.com` as service
- **Custom SMTP**: Configure with your provider's SMTP settings
