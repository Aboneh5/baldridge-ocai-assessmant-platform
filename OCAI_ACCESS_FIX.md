# OCAI Access Issue - Fix Complete

## 🐛 Issue Identified

Employees with OCAI access (via `subscribedAssessments`) were unable to access OCAI assessment, receiving error:
```
"No OCAI survey available. Please contact your administrator."
```

**Root Cause**: The system required an OCAI **survey** to exist for each organization before employees could access OCAI. However, when admins granted OCAI access to an organization, no survey was automatically created.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Auto-Create OCAI Survey on First Access

When an employee clicks "Start OCAI Assessment" and no survey exists, the system now:
1. **Automatically creates** an OCAI survey for their organization
2. **Stores** the survey ID in localStorage
3. **Redirects** them to the survey response page

This provides a seamless experience without requiring manual survey creation by admins.

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. Employee Assessments Dashboard
**File**: `src/app/employee/assessments/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed blocking alert for missing OCAI survey
- Changed OCAI link to always allow access (either to existing survey or intro page)
- Removed restriction that prevented OCAI access without survey

**Before**:
```typescript
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (assessment.type === 'OCAI' && !ocaiSurveyId && !isCompleted) {
    e.preventDefault()
    alert('No OCAI survey available. Please contact your administrator.')
  }
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (assessment.type === 'OCAI' && ocaiSurveyId) {
    localStorage.setItem('currentSurveyId', ocaiSurveyId)
  }
  // Allow OCAI access even without survey - will create one dynamically
}
```

### 2. OCAI Introduction Page
**File**: `src/app/assessments/ocai/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added state management for survey creation
- Added auto-create survey logic on "Start Assessment" click
- Added loading state while creating survey
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Key Addition**:
```typescript
const [creatingAssessment, setCreatingAssessment] = useState(false)
const [surveyId, setSurveyId] = useState<string | null>(null)

// Auto-create survey if not exists
if (!surveyId) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/surveys', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: `${org.name} - OCAI Culture Assessment`,
      description: 'Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument',
      type: 'OCAI',
      status: 'OPEN',
      organizationId: org.id,
      allowAnonymous: true,
      requireOrgEmailDomain: false,
    }),
  })

  // Navigate to newly created survey
  router.push(`/surveys/${newSurveyId}/respond`)
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Organization with OCAI Access (No Existing Survey)
**Steps**:
1. Admin creates organization `Acme Corp`
2. Admin sets `subscribedAssessments` to include `OCAI`
3. Admin creates access key for `Acme Corp`
4. Employee uses access key to sign in
5. Employee sees OCAI card on dashboard
6. Employee clicks "Start Assessment"
7. Employee clicks "Start OCAI Assessment" on intro page

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Survey auto-created with title: "Acme Corp - OCAI Culture Assessment"
- ✅ Employee redirected to survey response page
- ✅ Employee can complete assessment
- ✅ No error messages

### Scenario 2: Organization with Existing OCAI Survey
**Steps**:
1. Organization already has OCAI survey (created by admin or previous employee)
2. New employee uses access key to sign in
3. Employee clicks "Start Assessment"

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Uses existing survey (no duplicate created)
- ✅ Employee redirected to existing survey
- ✅ Smooth flow without delays

### Scenario 3: Multiple Employees from Same Organization
**Steps**:
1. Employee A starts OCAI → Survey auto-created
2. Employee B starts OCAI (same organization)
3. Employee C starts OCAI (same organization)

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ First employee creates survey
- ✅ Subsequent employees use same survey
- ✅ No duplicate surveys created
- ✅ All responses aggregated under same organization

## 📊 Survey Auto-Creation Details

### Survey Properties
```json
{
  "title": "{Organization Name} - OCAI Culture Assessment",
  "description": "Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument",
  "type": "OCAI",
  "status": "OPEN",
  "organizationId": "{orgId}",
  "allowAnonymous": true,
  "requireOrgEmailDomain": false
}
```

### Example
For organization **Acme Corp** (ID: `cmgbkw1ul0001uuxkezll33or`):
```json
{
  "title": "Acme Corp - OCAI Culture Assessment",
  "description": "Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument",
  "type": "OCAI",
  "status": "OPEN",
  "organizationId": "cmgbkw1ul0001uuxkezll33or",
  "allowAnonymous": true,
  "requireOrgEmailDomain": false
}
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Access Control
- ✅ **Organization-Scoped**: Survey created only for user's organization
- ✅ **Employee Permission**: Only users with OCAI in `assessmentTypes` can create
- ✅ **Anonymous Allowed**: Supports anonymous responses (privacy)
- ✅ **No Domain Restriction**: Doesn't require organizational email domain

### Data Integrity
- ✅ **One Survey Per Org**: Subsequent employees use existing survey
- ✅ **Unique Responses**: Each employee's responses stored separately
- ✅ **Aggregation Ready**: All responses linked to organization for reporting

---

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### Loading State
When creating survey, user sees:
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  [⟲] Preparing Assessment...   │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Error Handling
If survey creation fails:
```
Alert: "Failed to create assessment. Please contact your administrator."
```

If organization info missing:
```
Alert: "Organization information not found. Please sign in again."
→ Redirects to /auth/signin
```

---

## 📋 Admin Workflow (Simplified)

### Before Fix
```
1. Create organization
2. Set subscribedAssessments to include OCAI
3. Create access key
4. Manually create OCAI survey for organization ← Extra step
5. Share access key with employees
```

### After Fix
```
1. Create organization
2. Set subscribedAssessments to include OCAI
3. Create access key
4. Share access key with employees ← Survey auto-created on first use
```

**Benefit**: One less manual step for admins!
