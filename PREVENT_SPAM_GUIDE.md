# How to Prevent Emails from Going to Spam - Complete Guide

## üéØ Current Issue
Emails are sent from `onboarding@resend.dev` which email providers don't trust, causing them to go to spam.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Set Up Custom Domain (tenadamconsulting.com)

This will make emails come from `noreply@tenadamconsulting.com` instead, dramatically improving deliverability.

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Access Resend Dashboard

1. Go to: **https://resend.com**

### Step 2: Add Your Domain

1. Click the **"Add Domain"** button
2. Enter your domain: `tenadamconsulting.com`
3. Click **"Add Domain"**

### Step 3: Get DNS Records

Resend will provide you with DNS records to add. You'll see something like this:

```
Record 1 - SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all

Record 2 - DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Long string starting with p=...]

Record 3 - DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@tenadamconsulting.com
```

### Step 4: Add DNS Records to Your Domain Registrar

**Where is your domain registered?**
- GoDaddy
- Namecheap
- Cloudflare
- HostGator
- Other?

#### Example for GoDaddy:

1. Log into **GoDaddy.com**
2. Go to **"My Products"**
3. Find `tenadamconsulting.com` and click **"DNS"**
4. Click **"Add"** to add new records
5. For each record provided by Resend:
   - Select **Type**: TXT
   - Enter **Name**: (from Resend)
   - Enter **Value**: (copy from Resend)
   - Set **TTL**: 600 seconds (or leave default)
   - Click **"Save"**

#### Example for Namecheap:

1. Log into **Namecheap.com**
2. Go to **"Domain List"**
3. Click **"Manage"** next to `tenadamconsulting.com`
4. Click **"Advanced DNS"** tab
5. Click **"Add New Record"**
6. Add each TXT record from Resend
7. Click **"Save All Changes"**

#### Example for Cloudflare:

1. Log into **Cloudflare.com**
2. Select `tenadamconsulting.com`
3. Go to **"DNS"** section
4. Click **"Add record"**
5. Select **Type**: TXT
6. Enter Name and Value from Resend
7. Disable **Proxy** (click the cloud icon to make it gray)
8. Click **"Save"**

### Step 5: Verify Domain in Resend

1. After adding all DNS records, wait **5-10 minutes** for propagation
2. Go back to Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/domains
3. Find your domain `tenadamconsulting.com`
4. Click **"Verify Domain"**
5. Wait for verification (green checkmark ‚úÖ)

**If verification fails:**
- Wait 30 minutes and try again (DNS can take time)
- Double-check all DNS records are correct
- Make sure there are no typos
- Check TTL is not too high

### Step 6: Update Your Code

Once domain is verified, I'll update the email sender addresses in the code to:
- From: `Tenadam Assessment Hub <noreply@tenadamconsulting.com>`
- Reply-to: User's email address

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Domain verification failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 30-60 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Check DNS records are EXACTLY as Resend provided
3. Make sure there are no extra spaces in values
4. Verify you added records to the correct domain
5. Some registrars need "@" instead of blank for root domain

### Issue: "Still going to spam after domain setup"

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure domain is fully verified (green checkmark)
2. Wait 24 hours for email reputation to build
3. Ask recipients to mark as "Not Spam" first few times
4. Check DMARC policy is set to "p=none" initially
5. Monitor Resend analytics for bounce rates

### Issue: "Emails not sending at all"

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ Resend API key in `.env.local`
2. ‚úÖ Dev server restarted after adding API key
3. ‚úÖ No console errors in browser
4. ‚úÖ Resend dashboard shows attempts
5. ‚úÖ Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs tenadam-assessment`

### Issue: "DNS records not propagating"

**Solutions:**
1. Use DNS checker: https://dnschecker.org
2. Search for: `tenadamconsulting.com TXT`
3. Wait up to 48 hours (usually faster)
4. Clear DNS cache on your computer:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   ipconfig /flushdns

   # Mac
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
   ```
