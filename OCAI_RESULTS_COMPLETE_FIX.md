# OCAI Results Page - Complete Fix

## üêõ Issues Identified

### Issue 1: "No OCAI results available" Despite Completed Surveys
**Symptom**: Admin and facilitator pages always showed "No OCAI results available" even when employees had completed OCAI assessments.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Missing organizationId parameter**: The results API (`/api/ocai/organization-results`) required an `organizationId` query parameter, but the frontend was not sending it
2. **Missing authentication header**: The API required `x-user-id` header for authentication, but the frontend was not sending it
3. **No organization selector**: Admins couldn't select which organization's results to view

### Issue 2: No Organization Selection for Admins
**Symptom**: SYSTEM_ADMIN users couldn't choose which organization's results to view.

### Issue 3: Navigation Back to Dashboard Issue
**Symptom**: When navigating back from results page, users saw "Access Denied" message.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Organization Selection System

**Added organization loading on page mount**:
```typescript
const [organizations, setOrganizations] = useState<Organization[]>([]);
const [selectedOrgId, setSelectedOrgId] = useState<string>('');

const loadOrganizations = async (currentUser: any) => {
  if (currentUser.role === 'SYSTEM_ADMIN') {
    // Admin can see all organizations
    const response = await fetch('/api/admin/organizations', {
      headers: { 'x-user-id': currentUser.id },
    });
    if (response.ok) {
      const result = await response.json();
      setOrganizations(result.organizations || []);
      if (result.organizations && result.organizations.length > 0) {
        const firstOrgId = result.organizations[0].id;
        setSelectedOrgId(firstOrgId);
        loadResults(firstOrgId, currentUser);
      }
    }
  } else if (currentUser.role === 'FACILITATOR' && currentUser.organizationId) {
    // Facilitator can only see their own organization
    const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/organizations/${currentUser.organizationId}`, {
      headers: { 'x-user-id': currentUser.id },
    });
    if (response.ok) {
      const result = await response.json();
      setOrganizations([result.organization]);
      setSelectedOrgId(currentUser.organizationId);
      loadResults(currentUser.organizationId, currentUser);
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Fixed Results API Calls

**Added organizationId and authentication headers**:
```typescript
const loadResults = async (orgId?: string, currentUser?: any) => {
  const organizationId = orgId || selectedOrgId;
  const userToUse = currentUser || user;

  if (!organizationId || !userToUse) {
    return;
  }

  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/ocai/organization-results?organizationId=${organizationId}`,
    {
      headers: {
        'x-user-id': userToUse.id,
      },
    }
  );

  if (response.ok) {
    const result = await response.json();
    setData(result.data);
  }
};
```

### 3. Added Organization Selector UI (Admin Only)

**Dropdown for organization selection**:
```typescript
{user?.role === 'SYSTEM_ADMIN' && organizations.length > 0 && (
  <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6 mb-6">
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
      <Building2 className="w-6 h-6 text-blue-600" />
      <div className="flex-1">
        <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Select Organization
        </label>
        <select
          value={selectedOrgId}
          onChange={(e) => handleOrgChange(e.target.value)}
          className="w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
        >
          {organizations.map(org => (
            <option key={org.id} value={org.id}>
              {org.name}
            </option>
          ))}
        </select>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. Fixed Back Navigation

**Role-aware dashboard links**:
```typescript
const getDashboardLink = () => {
  if (user?.role === 'SYSTEM_ADMIN') {
    return '/admin/dashboard';
  } else if (user?.role === 'FACILITATOR') {
    return '/facilitator/dashboard';
  }
  return '/dashboard';
};

// Used in "Back to Dashboard" link
<Link href={getDashboardLink()}>
  Back to Dashboard
</Link>
```

## üîç Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

The OCAI results page uses **localStorage-based authentication** with custom headers:

1. User object stored in localStorage on login
2. `x-user-id` header sent with every API request
3. API validates user ID and role
4. API scopes data based on user role and organization

### Data Aggregation

**Organization-wide scores** are calculated using **mean (average)**:

```typescript
function calculateOrganizationAggregate(responses) {
  const totals = {
    now: { clan: 0, adhocracy: 0, market: 0, hierarchy: 0 },
    preferred: { clan: 0, adhocracy: 0, market: 0, hierarchy: 0 },
  };

  responses.forEach(response => {
    const nowScores = JSON.parse(response.nowScores);
    const preferredScores = JSON.parse(response.preferredScores);

    totals.now.clan += nowScores.clan;
    // ... add all dimensions
  });

  const n = responses.length;
  const nowMean = {
    clan: totals.now.clan / n,
    adhocracy: totals.now.adhocracy / n,
    market: totals.now.market / n,
    hierarchy: totals.now.hierarchy / n,
  };

  // Calculate delta
  const delta = {
    clan: preferredMean.clan - nowMean.clan,
    // ... for all dimensions
  };

  return { n, now: nowMean, preferred: preferredMean, delta };
}
```

### JSON Parsing

OCAI scores are stored as **JSON strings** in the database but need to be **parsed** before display:

```typescript
const nowScores = typeof response.nowScores === 'string'
  ? JSON.parse(response.nowScores)
  : response.nowScores;
```

This handles both cases:
- Scores stored as JSON string: `'{"clan":25,"adhocracy":30,...}'`
- Scores already parsed: `{clan:25,adhocracy:30,...}`

## üìû If Issues Persist

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Check if organizations exist**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console on /ocai/results page
   localStorage.getItem('user')
   // Should show user with role and organizationId
   ```

2. **Check API responses**:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Navigate to `/ocai/results`
   - Look for `/api/admin/organizations` request
   - Look for `/api/ocai/organization-results?organizationId=X` request
   - Check if both return 200 OK

3. **Check for OCAI responses in database**:
   - Run Prisma Studio: `npx prisma studio`
   - Open "Response" table
   - Verify responses exist with non-null `nowScores` and `preferredScores`

4. **Check user authentication**:
   ```javascript
   // Should see x-user-id header in Network tab
   // Value should match localStorage user.id
   ```

5. **Check console for errors**:
   - Open browser console
   - Look for any error messages
   - Check if API calls are failing

‚úÖ **OCAI Results viewing is now fully functional with organization selection and proper data display!**
