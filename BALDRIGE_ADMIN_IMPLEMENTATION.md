# Baldrige Admin Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive admin functionality for Baldrige assessments with organization-based data storage, unique assessment IDs, and Excel/CSV export capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
**File: `prisma/schema.prisma`**

Added new `BaldrigeSubmission` model to track each assessment:
- **Unique Assessment ID**: Format `BLD-{ORG_PREFIX}-{YEAR}-{SEQUENCE}` (e.g., `BLD-ACME12-2025-001`)
- **Organization-based tracking**: Each submission is linked to an organization
- **Metadata storage**: Tracks user info, access key, submission timestamps
- **Automatic sequencing**: Sequential numbering per organization per year

```prisma
model BaldrigeSubmission {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  assessmentId      String   @unique // Human-readable ID
  userId            String
  organizationId    String?
  surveyId          String?
  accessKey         String?
  startedAt         DateTime @default(now())
  submittedAt       DateTime?
  isCompleted       Boolean  @default(false)
  totalQuestions    Int      @default(0)
  answeredQuestions Int      @default(0)
  metadata          Json?
  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### 2. Submission API Enhancement
**File: `src/app/api/baldrige/submit/route.ts`**

**Key Features:**
- Generates unique assessment ID per organization
- Creates submission record with full metadata
- Links submission to user and organization
- Stores access key information

**Assessment ID Format:**
- Individual assessments: `BLD-INDV-{YEAR}-{SEQ}`
- Organization assessments: `BLD-{ORG_ID_PREFIX}-{YEAR}-{SEQ}`
- Sequential per organization per year

### 3. Admin API Enhancement
**File: `src/app/api/admin/baldrige/responses/route.ts`**

**Enhanced Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  userId: string;
  userName: string;
  userEmail: string;
  accessKey: string;
  assessmentId: string;  // NEW: Unique assessment ID
  completedAt: string;
  surveyId: string | null;
  surveyTitle: string;
  responses: BaldrigeResponse[];
}
```

### 4. Admin Dashboard Enhancement
**File: `src/app/admin/baldrige/page.tsx`**

**New Features:**
1. **Assessment ID Display**: Shows unique ID for each completed assessment
2. **Dual Export Options**: Both CSV and Excel formats available

## Data Flow

### Assessment Submission Flow
1. User completes Baldrige assessment
2. Submit API validates all questions answered
3. System generates unique assessment ID based on organization
4. Creates `BaldrigeSubmission` record with:
   - Unique assessment ID
   - Organization ID (from access key)
   - User details and metadata
   - Timestamp information
5. Marks `BaldrigeProgress` as completed
6. Returns assessment ID to user

### Admin Data Retrieval Flow
1. Fetch all `BaldrigeSubmission` records (completed only)
2. Fetch all `BaldrigeProgress` records with user/org info
3. Fetch all `BaldrigeResponse` records with question details
4. Match submissions with users to get assessment IDs
5. Organize by organization → users → responses
6. Return structured data with assessment IDs

### Export Flow
1. User selects organization to export
2. System collects all questions and responses
3. Builds data structure with Assessment ID as first column
4. For CSV: Generates CSV with proper escaping
5. For Excel: Creates formatted worksheet with optimized columns
6. Downloads file named: `baldrige_{ORG_NAME}_{TIMESTAMP}.{csv|xlsx}`

## Assessment ID Examples

### Individual Assessments (No Organization)
